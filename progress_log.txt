# REPORT 2
A basic 3D rendering engine has been implemented in OpenGL using the library lwjgl.
A Java FFT algorithm has been added and tested with a basic 2D animation.
I am lacking behind a little bit with the plan but I am certain that 
I can manage to make up for it in the coming weeks.

# REPORT 3
Another animation has been added, inspired by the video of Daniel Shiffman. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjbKsOkN1Oc)
There are still some basic parts missing that will be implemented in the next 2 weeks. 
Unfortunately these features couldn't be realized sooner, as other courses required most of my time.
